# Video-Player

The purpose of this project was to apply the principles of good user interface to a real life problem, experience the interaction design lifecycle as a group and then design, evaluate and develop a complex GUI application in Qt.

In the case of this project we decided on the creaation of a video player, where we would hold regular meetings, and completed development in 4 development cycles where each cycle consisted of prototyping an improvement, implementing it and then evaluating the prototype. A major part of this project was the design stage where we initally decided upon the requiremnts and the design cycle.
